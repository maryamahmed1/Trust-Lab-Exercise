## Trust-Lab-Exercise

Initial Plan:
I will be focusing on Police Department reports in the year 2018. 
(originally I wanted to search for accesibility of Narcan in the area corresponding to property taxes in the region to see if there is a discrepancy that favors the wealthy, however there was no data in the datasf that I could pull from). Narcan is a life saving prescription medicince used to treat the overdose of opiods. In many regions it is available for free at the pharmacy, however there was not any data I could find in the data pertaining to narcan in the data banks that were provided.

This analysis could have been a vital resource when urging policy makers to give the public free access to Narcan and in result save countless lives.

Second Plan:
Hence I shifted my perspective a bit to be able to utilize the data that I have access to.
My analysis will focus on the finding the location of drug overdose locations to see if there is a connection between police incident reports relating to drug abuse and the property taxes of the area. The property taxes will give insight insight into the weatlh of the people that live in the area. At first, I was looking at property taxes but realized that the Police Department data set I am using stated the District in San Francisco which may be more efficient to utilize.
